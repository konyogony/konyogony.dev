# Installing Arch

In this guide, I will show you how to install Arch from scratch on your machine **with dual boot**. I will try to be as simple as possible while also providing good information. If I am wrong or you find a mistake, [contact me](https://localhost/docs/about#contacting-me).

## 1. Getting the Arch .ISO file

First, you should download the Arch .ISO file from their [official website](https://archlinux.org/download/). Scroll down until you find your country and download it from there. Once you have the .ISO file, move it to your media. I recommend using a tool like [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/download.html) - it helps you manage multiple ISO files stored on your storage without the need for Rufus.

## 2. Booting into the media

After getting the .ISO file onto your media, restart your device and repeatedly hit the `DEL` or `HOME` key on the keyboard. This should boot you into your BIOS. Then navigate to the `BOOT` tab using the arrow keys. Once there, go down until you find your media device name. _Tip: It might include the word 'Ventoy' in the device's name_. When you find it, use the arrow keys to select it and click `Enter` to boot into it.

After your PC has booted into Ventoy, select the `archlinux.iso` file and press Enter to boot into it. It might ask you which mode to boot into; select normal and continue.

## 3. Getting Wi-Fi working

When you have successfully booted into the Arch Linux installation tool, you will have no internet connection if you are using Wi-Fi. To solve this problem, we will use the `iwctl` tool. This tool from Intel allows us to use Wi-Fi adapters to connect to wireless networks. This is how it works:

```sh
# We first enter the tool:
iwctl

# Then we get the device name using this command:
device list

# I will now refer to this device as $DEVICE

# Now using that device name, we scan for networks and get their names:
station $DEVICE scan
station $DEVICE get-networks

# Find your network name; I will now call it $NETWORKNAME

# After getting the network name, we connect to it:
station $DEVICE connect "$NETWORKNAME"

# It might prompt you to enter the password; if so, do it.
# Note: When you enter the password, the input might be invisible.

# You should now be connected; to confirm this, run:
station $DEVICE show
# The 'state' field needs to be 'connected'.
```

## 4. Installing packages

After getting the wi-fi working you have to first install some neccessary packages for easy installation.

```sh
# Enter sudo mode
sudo -i

# Download keyring & archinstall packages
pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring
pacman -S archinstall

# Exit sudo mode
exit
```

The `archlinux-keyring` package is used to safely store keyrings for different apps. `archinstall` is script which will help us to install arch linux fast and with ease.
