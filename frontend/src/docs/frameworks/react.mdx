# React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where you need a fast, interactive user experience.

## Features

-   **Component-Based:** React encourages building UIs using reusable components.
-   **Declarative:** React allows you to describe how the UI should look based on the state and automatically manages the updates.
-   **Virtual DOM:** React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update and render the right components.
-   **Hooks:** React provides hooks to manage state and side effects in functional components.

## Example

Hereâ€™s a simple React component example:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Greeting({ name }) {
    return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}

export default function App() {
    return <Greeting name='World' />;
}
```
