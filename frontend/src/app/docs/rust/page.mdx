# Rust

Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency. It is known for its strong emphasis on preventing memory-related bugs.

## Features

-   **Ownership:** Rustâ€™s ownership system enforces memory safety without needing a garbage collector.
-   **Concurrency:** Rust provides concurrency features that help prevent data races and other concurrency issues.
-   **Zero-Cost Abstractions:** Rust aims to provide abstractions that have no runtime cost compared to equivalent manual implementations.
-   **Pattern Matching:** Rust has powerful pattern matching capabilities through enums and the `match` statement.

## Example

Here's a simple example of a Rust function:

```rs
fn greet(name: &str) -> String {
    format!("Hello, {}!", name)
}

fn main() {
    println!("{}", greet("World"));
}
```
