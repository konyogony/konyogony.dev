# JavaScript

JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language commonly used for web development. It is a core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.

## Features

-   **Dynamic Typing:** JavaScript does not require you to declare data types explicitly.
-   **Event-Driven:** JavaScript is often used to create interactive web pages through event handling.
-   **Functional Programming:** Supports first-class functions, closures, and other functional programming concepts.
-   **Asynchronous Operations:** Handles asynchronous operations using callbacks, promises, and async/await.

## Example

Here's a basic example of a JavaScript function:

```js
function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
```
