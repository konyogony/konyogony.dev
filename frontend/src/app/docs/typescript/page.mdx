# TypeScript

`TypeScript` is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It adds optional static typing to JavaScript, which can improve development efficiency and code quality.

## Features

-   **Static Typing:** TypeScript allows you to add type annotations to your JavaScript code. This feature helps prevent many types of bugs and can improve the maintainability of your code. For example, you can specify that a function expects a string parameter and returns a string:

    ```ts
    function greet(name: string): string {
        return `Hello, ${name}!`;
    }
    ```

-   **Advanced Types:** TypeScript includes advanced type features such as union types, intersection types, and type guards. These features enable you to express complex data structures and constraints more precisely.

    -   **Union Types:** A union type allows a variable to be one of several types.

        ```ts
        function printId(id: number | string) {
            console.log(`ID: ${id}`);
        }
        ```

    -   **Intersection Types:** An intersection type combines multiple types into one.

        ```ts
        interface User {
            name: string;
        }

        interface Admin {
            adminSince: Date;
        }

        type AdminUser = User & Admin;
        ```

    -   **Type Guards:** Type guards help you perform type checks at runtime, ensuring your code behaves correctly based on the actual type of a value.

        ```ts
        function isNumber(value: any): value is number {
            return typeof value === 'number';
        }
        ```

-   **ES6+ Features:** TypeScript supports many ECMAScript 6 and beyond features, including async/await, destructuring, and classes. This support allows you to write modern JavaScript code while still benefiting from TypeScript's type system.

    ```ts
    class Person {
        constructor(public name: string) {}

        greet() {
            return `Hello, ${this.name}!`;
        }
    }

    const person = new Person('World');
    console.log(person.greet());
    ```

-   **Tooling:** TypeScript integrates seamlessly with editors and IDEs, providing features like autocomplete, type checking, and refactoring tools. This integration helps you write code more efficiently and with fewer errors.

## Example

Here's a simple example of a TypeScript function:

```ts
function greet(name: string): string {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
```
