# Commit Guidelines

I have recently implemented custom commit guidelines to organize and manage my code effectively. The commit message format should look like this:

`[part:type] description`

> _Note: part & type should always be lowercase._

### example

-   `[frontend:fix] Fixed navbar position`
-   `[frontend:ui] Added a modal`
-   `[backend:perf] Changed database structure for better performance`

## Part

This should signify the part of the website that is being worked on. It helps easily identify which changes relate to what part of the project and understand the scope of the commit. You can choose **only one** of the following:

-   **Backend**
-   **Frontend**

## Type

This specifies the kind of change you are making. It should accurately reflect the nature of the change. You can select one of these types:

-   **Fix** - When you fix something that was broken, like a bug or an issue.
    -   example `[frontend:fix] Resolved broken button hover effect`
-   **Refactor** - When you improve or modify the code without affecting its functionality.
    -   example `[backend:refactor] Simplified API response logic`
-   **Docs** - When you update the documentation or wiki.
    -   example `[frontend:docs] Updated README with new setup instructions`
-   **UI** - When you add or modify user interface components.
    -   example `[frontend:ui] Created responsive footer`
-   **Feature** - When you implement a new feature.
    -   example `[backend:feature] Added user authentication endpoint`
-   **Revert** - When you revert a previous commit or change.
    -   example `[frontend:revert] Reverted incorrect color scheme change`
-   **Perf** - Performance-related changes that improve the speed or efficiency of the code.
    -   example `[backend:perf] Optimized query to reduce database load time`
-   **Misc** - If the change doesnt fall under any category you could classify it as misc.
    -   example `[frontend:misc] Removed yarn.lock file`

## Description

This part should give a brief and clear description of the change. Keep it concise, but ensure it provides enough context so that others understand what was modified. It should follow the format:

### Tips for Writing Good Descriptions:

-   **Be concise but clear**: Use active language to make it easy to understand the change.
    -   Bad: `[frontend:fix] Something got fixed`
    -   Good: `[frontend:fix] Corrected alignment issue in header`
-   **Focus on the "why" and "what"**: Explain why the change was necessary and what was fixed or added.
-   **Avoid vague terms**: Phrases like "minor changes" or "updated files" should be avoided.
